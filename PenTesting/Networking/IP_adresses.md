# IP addresses
Device talking to device needs an IP address
`ifconfig/ipconfig`

`inet` is in decimal notation `inet6` in hexadecimal.

 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 = 32 bits = 4 bytes
192.168.57.139

 |--> realisticly this rapresent a bunch o 1 and 0 so we have a human readable format  
      8 bits = 11111111.11111111.11111111.11111111. or 0
      Each of the sets of numbers (octets) can be between 0-255

128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
 0   0  0  0 0 1 1 1 = 7.7.7.7
 
ipv4 = 2^32 = 4,294,967,296 ---> possible amount of ip addresses, they are already used all!
 
ipv6 = 2^128 = 3.4028236692093846346337460743177e+38 wystarczjąco dla wszystkich :)

nat = network address transation. Powiedzmy, że mam 20 urządzeń które będą potrzebować 20ip adresów
Czy kradnę 20 adresów z tych 4 bilionów? NIE bo nat!

With nat we assigned thest 20 private ip address spaces to 192.168.57.139 which is a private address only know to you  
and we pass them out through what is acalled a public ip address

Subnet Maska/Netmask

Default getaway/aka Router

DHCP --> routers assigns ip addresses to your devices.
IP addresses are given via subnet mask

```
Ipv4       192.168.57.139
            |   |   |  |
Sbnet Mask 255.255.255.0

If the corrisponding Subnet Mask octet is 255 then the Ipv4 Octent will alweys be the same in your local network
here: 192.168.57 --> Network portion of the IP address is like the street name where you live
The lat number in Subnet mask = 0 seys that the corrsiponding cna be whatever number between 0-255  
139-->Host is like your home number
```
two ip addresses are reserved, yuor address and the broadcast address + router so 253
