# Network
## IPv4
Device talking to device needs an IP address --> identifier of a device in a network
Can be Public and Private.
Public address is assigned to your router and can communicate with the internet
are unique, used externally, assigned by an ISP, not free.
Private can't be registered are no unique only unique for your local area, used internally, are free 
assigned by router on the internet and the have to be "converted" to public first.
Router gives private ip addresses, and when the devices have to access internet router translates these private to public
via NET, also translate public to private.

`inet` is in decimal notation `inet6` in hexadecimal.

IP addresses are a 32-bit long numbers made up of four octets and each octet is 
normally described in decimal numbers. 
Eight bits of data or a single octet can represent all decimal numbers from 0-255.

 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 = 32 bits = 4 bytes
192.168.57.139 --> dotted decimal notation

 |--> realisticly this rapresent a bunch o 1 and 0 so we have a human readable format  
      8 bits = 11111111.11111111.11111111.11111111. or 0
      Each of the sets of numbers (octets) can be between 0-255

128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
 0   0  0  0 0 1 1 1 = 7.7.7.7
 
ipv4 = 2^32 = 4,294,967,296 ---> possible amount of ip addresses, they are already used all!
                                this is why privat IP addresses have ben developed

12.34.56.78 is a valid IP address but 123.456.789.100 would not be because it has numbers larger than could be represented by eight bits. 

 

IP addresses belong to the networks, not to the devices attached to those networks. Your laptop will 
always have the same MAC address no matter where you use it, but it'll have a different IP address assigned to it at an Internet caf√© 
than it would when you're at home. 


Many modern networks, you can connect a new device and an IP address will be assigned 
to it automatically through a technology known as `Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol - DHCP`. An IP address assigned this way is 
known as a `dynamic IP address`. The opposite of this is known as a `static IP address`, which must be configured on a node manually. 
In most cases, static IP addresses are reserved for servers and network devices while dynamic IP addresses are reserved for clients.
