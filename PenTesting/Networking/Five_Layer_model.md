# The TCP/IP five layer model

| Layer Name | Protocol | Protocol Data Unit | Addressing | Explanation |
|------------|----------|--------------------|------------|-------------|
| Application | HTTP,SMTP etc...| Messages | n/a | 
| Transport | TCP/UDP | Segment | Port#'s | Sorts out which client and server programs are supposed to get that data
| Network | IP | Packet/Datagram | IP Address | Allows different networks to communicate with each other through devices known as routers
| Data Link | Ethernet, Wi-Fi | Frames | MAC Address | Responsible for defining a common way of interpreting these signals so network devices can communicate
| Physical | n/a | Bits | n/a | Physical devices that interconnect computers

`Etherent`: Ethernet standards also define a protocol responsible for getting data 
to nodes on the same network or link
`Internetwork`: A collection of networks connected together throughout routers (Internet)

The physical layer is the delivery truck and the roads. The data link layer is 
how the delivery trucks get from one intersection to the next over and over. 
The network layer identifies which roads need to be taken to get from address A to address B. 
The transport layer ensures that delivery driver knows how to knock on your door 
to tell you your package has arrived. 
And the application layer is the contents of the package itself.
