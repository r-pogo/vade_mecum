# Enumeration
The ability to find out everything about a target by enumerating its ports and services,  
its uses and accounts, it's processes and just about everything that can be exposed and enumerator.

Example:
- Extracts usernames
- Gather host info via null sessions
- Port enumeration
- User account enumeration
- Special protocol enumeration

Enumeration allows us to understand the target before testing

Useful Services to Enumerate:
1. Domain Name System (DNS): Port 53
2. Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) : Port 25
3. Remote Procedure Calls (RPC): Port 135
4. NetBIOS: Port 139
5. Simple Network Management Protocols (SNMP): Port 161
6. Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Port 389
7. Server Message Block (SMB): Port 445

### NetBIOS
The Network Basic Input-Output System - NetBIOS, provides session layer services  
for Windows systems, which allow applications on separate computers to communicate
over a local area network.  

NetBIOS is an API specification rather than a protocol and requires a networking protocol  
to carry NetBIOS payloads.

- The NetBIOS name service runs on UDP port 137

- Datagram distribution service on UDP port 138.

- The NetBIOS over TCP/IP session service runs on TCP port 139.

### SMB
The Server Message Block, or SMB protocol, is an application layer service used to enable shared access  
to account, files, printers, serial ports, and miscellaneous communications between nodes on a network.  
This not only works on the local network, but can also be accessed through IP across the internet.  
SAMBA is a free software implementation of SMB which can integrate with Windows systems

### Distributed Computing Environment DCE/RPC

The distributed computing environment, DCE, is a software system developed in the early 1990s as a framework
and toolkit for developing client/server applications.
The framework includes a remote procedure call, RPC mechanism, known as DCE/RPC.
This was originally commissioned by the Open Software Foundation.
While DCE has not seen much success in practical implementation, its underlying concepts have had substantial influence
over subsequent efforts.

The Remote Procedure Call mechanism is used to implement client/server communications,
both interprocess within a host system and interprocess between systems.
The protocol enables the client and server to connect via what are known as end points,
which to the programmer look like function calls.
The RPC mechanism is the simplest way to implement client/server applications
because it keeps the details of network communications out of your application code.
Each side behaves, as much as possible, the way it would within a traditional application.
The programmer on the client side issues a call and the programmer on the server side writes a procedure
to carry out the desired function.

### Microsoft RPC
The Microsoft implementation of RPC, MSRPC, is an extended implementation of RPC
which operates over SMB or across TCP/IP.
It's used extensively in Microsoft systems.
The Windows server domains protocols are entirely MSRPC-based.
Microsoft DNS administrative tool uses MSRPC. 
Microsoft Exchange server 5.5's administrative front-ends are all MSRPC client/server applications.
And the MAPI implementation was made more secure by delivering MAPI as MSRPC functions
that enable encryption at the MSRPC layer.
