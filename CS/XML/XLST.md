# XLST
XSL (eXtensible Stylesheet Language) is a styling language for XML.

XSL can be used to define how an XML file should be displayed by transforming the XML file into a format that is recognizable to a browser.  
Each XML element is transformed into an HTML element.  
XSL consist of three parts necessary for displaying XML data:
- XSLT a language for transforming XML documents
- XPath a language for navigating in XML documents
- XSL-FO a language for formatting XML documents

XSLT stands for XSL Transformations and is the most important part of XSL
XSLT can be used to transform an XML document into another XML document or another type of  
document that is recognized by a browser. XSLT transforms an XML source-tree into an XML result-tree.
XSLT depend on the use of XPATH tto navigate the XML document
