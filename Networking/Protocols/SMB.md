# SMB
`Server Message Block`: is a network file sharing protocol that allows applications  
to read, write, and request services from remote computers, primarily in Windows environments.
Most common use cases:
- File sharing: Users can access, modify, and manage files on remote systems as if they were local
- Printer sharing: When you send print jobs to remote printers, it's typically SMB that manages this
- Remote administration: IT administrators can use SMB to remotely manage servers, which includes  
the configuration of services, shares, and access permissions.
